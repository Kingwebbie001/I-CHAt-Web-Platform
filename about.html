                <h1>The Problem:</h1>
                <h2>The Framework</h2>
                <p>The I-CHAt Framework provides a structure to support the understanding and application of 
                    homeshare programs targeting university students and older adults. The Framework has
                    been co-designed to guide interested parties who would like to be involved in a 
                    Homeshare program like I-CHAt. </p>
                <h2>What is ‘Homeshare’?</h2>
                <p>Homeshare programs have been recognised globally as innovative solutions to ageing with
                    independence and housing crises. The concept is simple: older adults with a ‘spare’ room
                    (homeowners) are matched with an individual (sharers) in a mutually beneficial
                    accommodation arrangement agreed between the two parties.</p>
                <p>Programs have grown in popularity in countries including Canada, Ireland, and South Korea
                    since the turn of the 21st Century. The Homeshare Australia & New Zealand Alliance (HANZA;
                    a partner on this project) highlights limited awareness of homeshare programs in Australia
                    outside Victoria, ACT, SA and NSW – to the best of our knowledge, there is no evidence of
                    existing intergenerational homeshare programs being offered in Queensland at present. </p>
                <h2>What makes Homeshare programs a success?</h2>
                <p>Benefits of intergenerational homeshare programs include positive impacts on the quality of
                    life, physical- and mental-health of older adults, and increased interpersonal and
                    communication skills in younger adults. Either party may experience some financial benefit,
                    whilst reduced ageist perceptions and attitudes have been demonstrated for all involved.
                    However, there remains a substantial need for further research and evaluation of the benefits
                    of homeshare programs.</p>
