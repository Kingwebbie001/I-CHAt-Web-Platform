                <h1>Why be an organisation supporting homeshare?</h1>
                <p>Homeshare programs have been recognised globally as innovative solutions to ageing with independence and housing crises. 
                    The concept is simple: older adults with a ‘spare’ room (homeowners) are matched with an individual (sharers) in a mutually 
                    beneficial accommodation arrangement agreed between the two parties. 
                    Benefits of intergenerational homeshare programs include positive impacts on the quality of life, physical- 
                    and mental-health of older adults, and increased interpersonal and learning communication skills to interact with younger adults. 
                    Either party may experience some financial benefit, whilst reduced ageist perceptions and attitudes have been demonstrated for all involved.</p>
                <h2>It’s a BIG problem</h2>
                <p>Currently, 93.5% of older Australians live in households/in the community, with 1.3 million requiring some assistance with everyday activities. 
                    Almost two-thirds (65.9%) have this need met (a ~4% decrease from 2015), yet the remainder, 34% (~442,000 people), do not. 
                    The Sunshine Coast (as per the rest of Australia) is concurrently facing an accommodation crisis, with a lack of affordable and 
                    accessible housing exacerbated by a regional rent increase of 36% from 2020-2022. Young adults between the ages of 12-24 years, 
                    make up 23% of all people experiencing homelessness nationally. This is especially pertinent for UniSC students who, like many 
                    students around Australia, move to the region to study yet face ongoing challenges to find and maintain appropriate accommodation. 
                    This results in financial shortfall, risk of dropping out of study, increased vulnerability, inadequate housing and/or homelessness and 
                    students residing in vehicles on campus.</p>
                <h2>Be part of the solution!</h2>
                <p>Intergenerational Cohabitation or Homeshare, where individuals across generations share residential space, 
                    presents a possible solution to both issues. Evidence shows that cohousing and homeshare programs decrease isolation for older adults, 
                    positively impact quality of life and benefit physical and mental health, with the potential to save health and social services spending. 
                    What is more, intergenerational cohousing has been shown to increase support and a sense of community within and beyond residents.</p>
                <p>Your organisation can be supported to be the first homeshare coordinator on the sunshine coast with the support of HANZA, 
                    the peak body for homeshare in Australia and New Zealand, the resources developed through rigorous codesign strategies and large 
                    organisations like the Sunshine Coast Council. Suncare and UniSC to support you get going.</p>
